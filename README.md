# Vector-Database-ChromaDB-with-OpenAI-
ChromaDB is an open-source vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings (vector representations of text, images, etc.). Often used in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), it enables fast semantic search by converting data into vectors, storing them, and retrieving similar items for queries efficiently.
